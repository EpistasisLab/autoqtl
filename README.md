AutoQTL : Automated Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis
==================================

**AutoQTL** is an automated machine learning tool for QTL analysis.
The goal of AutoQTL is to automate QTL analysis by building an analytics pipeline optimized for explaining variation in a quantitative trait given a set of genetic variants. It uses genetic programming (GP) as the search and optimization method.

Running AutoQTL
==================================
Anyone interested in AutoQTL can clone the repository and run the autoqtl_test.py file in the 'test' folder in a python environment made by using the requirements.txt file.
This software is built as part of a proof-of-concept and hence is still under development. 
 
We continue to work on to add new features and functionality to AutoQTL and make it available as a python package. 
Suggestions are welcome.
