AutoQTL : Automated Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis
==================================

**AutoQTL** is an automated machine learning tool for QTL Analysis.
The goal of AutoQTL is to automate QTL analysis by building an analytics pipeline optimized for explaining variation in a quantitative trait given a set of genetic variants. It uses Genetic Programming as the search and optimization method.
